    Training DNN can be extremely memory- and energy-consuming. With the increasing size of DNN models and prevalence of using power-hungry GPU, memory capacity and energy consumption are becoming major scalable bottlenecks of training DNN. In this talk, we study how to leverage hardware heterogeneity and runtime system innovation to address the above problem. 

    From the memory perspective, we leverage the emerging heterogeneous big-memory system (HM) to increase memory capacity, and introduce a software runtime system, Sentinel. Sentinel automatically optimizes tensor placement and allocation on HM. By coordinating operating system (OS) and application runtime-level profiling to bridge the semantic gap between OS and applications, Sentinel enables tensor-level profiling. This novel profiling method enables co-allocation of tensors with similar lifetime and memory access frequency into the same pages, which avoids unnecessary data movement, improves tensor movement efficiency, and enables larger batch training on GPU. Sentinel outperforms seven state-of-the-art solutions in training throughput by 17%-2x.  

    From the energy saving perspective, we introduce a server architecture with both GPU and FPGA in a single machine. Such architecture provides flexibility to run operations of DNN training on power-efficient FPGA to save energy. Furthermore, we introduce a software framework, hyper-training, that schedules operations and maps them into FPGA and GPU based on offline analysis and characterization of operations to avoid performance loss. We show that with GPU and FPGA, hyper-training reduces energy consumption by 41% on average (up to 60%) without loss in training throughput; Hyper-training effectively enforces power caps with 11% performance improvement than without hyper-training.
