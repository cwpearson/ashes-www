      In the Exa-scale and extreme heterogeneity era, programming is becoming an extremely
      expensive task. Current portable programming techniques, such as directive-based programming model,
      or more recently, the C++ template libraries, have been positioned as potential solutions with other
      approaches such as task-based runtimes or domain specific languages (DSLs). However, there is still a
      long way to walk towards a fully agnostic programming solution, where application developers don't
      have to worry about hardware/software constraints. In this talk, I will explore some current efforts that
      face such a challenge, providing some examples where less complicated programs are often more
      performing. Examples, of such efforts are the use and integration of performance models into the
      languages, as well as the exploitation of prescriptive approaches instead of descriptive ones. Future
      directions, such as the integration of AI-accelerated and -assisted techniques into programming
      solutions will be discussed and presented too.

    <h4><b>Bio:</b>
      Pedro Valero-Lara (PhD) is a Computer Scientist in the Programming Systems Group into the
      Advanced Computing Systems Research Section and Computer Science and Mathematics Division of Oak
      Ridge National Laboratory. The experience of Pedro is focused on high performance, parallel, and
      scientific computing/programming applied to numerous problems of research and industrial interest.
      His work is part of several reference software packages for scientific computing: Kokkos, IRIS, Cray/HPE
      LibSci-Acc, PLASMA, NVIDIA cuSparse, among others. Pedro was awarded by the IEEE-CS Early Career
      Researcher Award for Excellence in HPC in 2020, the Juan de la Cierva Fellowship in 2018, FPI-CIEMAT
      scholarship in 2011 and Microsoft Imagine Cup in 2009. Previously, he held different leading positions in
      industry, as Sr Research Engineer at Cray, and academia, as founder and lead of the Linear Algebra and
      Math Libraries unit at Barcelona Supercomputing Center. He has participating in numerous important
      projects, such as Exascale Computing Project, CORAL-2, Human Brain Project, among many others.
      Recently, his work “KokkACC: Enhancing Kokkos with OpenACC” was awarded as the best paper of the
      9th Workshop on Accelerator Programming using Directives (WACCPD’22), held in conjunction with the
      International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC’22).
